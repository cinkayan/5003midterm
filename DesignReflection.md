Design Experience Reflection

The midterm project helped me realize the importance of the design document. In another word, the importance of a very clear idea and structure.

My biggest modification of the site during the process of making this website was when I finished writing the three user stories. I choose Guzheng because there are some biases about Guzheng, such as it is a girly and old-fashioned instrument. Therefore, I just present basic knowledge and diverse Guzheng performance video on the website for my first draft. As I was writing the user stories, I think from the users’ perspectives: if I were he/she, what information do I need the most? How should the website lay out related content, so it makes sense to my logic flow?

My second draft is much more targeted, concise and user friendly based on my three segmented target audience group. I designed a survey to assess the level of my user profile. Based on the result of the survey, I recommend related tracks for my users. In this way, my users are able to enjoy a personalized Guzheng journey that addresses their concerns perfectly. For example, for male users, I designed a Gentleman track. Male users will expose to stronger and more rhythmic melody played by Guzheng. I also have Cool Guzheng track, this track will meet the need of people who wanted to use modern interpretation to perform this traditional instrument.

The website’s function also changed after I having a clear view of what I want to do. For example, I deleted the teachers’ information section and added a forum to the website. Why? I don’t want to make this website a Guzheng teaching website, instead, I want to encourage people to dig deep and explore the various beauty of Guzheng. A new need therefore came out: people wanted to make friends with other people with same or similar interest. They can even partner together to see what magic can Guzheng do with the help of other art forms.

A Creative Director told me: “Good design is not about make things pretty, but more importantly, serves a purpose.” I understand it now.
